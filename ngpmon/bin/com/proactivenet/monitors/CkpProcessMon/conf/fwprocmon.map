# Description : Output attribute Name to attribute Id mapping
# Syntax      :
#  - Line in the form of  AttributeName:AttributeId
#  - Blank lines and comment lines ignored
#  - Comment lines must start with a # in first column.
#  - Attribute IDs must start from 10, and cannot be more than 50
#    i.e. Max attribute ID should be 10+50.
#    This is beacause there are 4+5 input attributes.
#  - No restriction of IDs being sequential, except that of readability.
#  - White space in variable:value lines not tolerated.
#  - Variable name cannot have embedded spaces
# This filename should be supplied in the fourth input attribute, namely
# 'VarNameToAttrIdMapping'. In case it is not, or an incorrect name is
# specified, the default of "Pronto_var_1-n" will be in place.
